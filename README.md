## Notes:
All processing was done in R. The R folder contains the scripts, numbered consecutively, to reproduce the analyzes and generate tables and figures presented in the manuscript. The outputs folder contains the output files of each R scripts. The starting number of each one of these files (e.g., “3.2.2. Figure S1 Compare females and males.png”) identifies the source script (e.g., 3.0. Plotting size traits.r).  

## R packages
The software and R packages associated with each script are enlisted in the corresponding R session files.
