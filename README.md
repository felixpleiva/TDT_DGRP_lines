# Heat tolerance of Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines

This repository contains code and data needed to reproduce the manuscript: Leiva FP, Santos M, Rezende EL, Verberk WCEP. Intraspecific variation of heat tolerance in a model ectotherm: the role of oxygen, cell size and body size.

## Cite the repository as:

Leiva FP, Santos M, Rezende E, & Verberk WCEP. (2021). Paper data and code of manuscript: Intraspecific variation on heat tolerance in a model ectotherm: the role of oxygen, cell size and body size. Zenodo. <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5120028>.

## Notes:

All processing was done in R. The R folder contains the scripts to reproduce the analyses and generate tables and figures presented in the manuscript. The "Outputs" folder contains the output files of each R script. The starting number of each one of these files (e.g., "3.2.2. Figure S2 Compare females and males.png") identifies the source script (e.g., 3.0. Plotting size traits.r). I describe each script and data frame in more detail in the [Metadata](https://github.com/felixpleiva/TDT_DGRP_lines/blob/main/Metadata.txt) file.

## R packages

The software and R packages associated with each script are enlisted in the corresponding R session files.
